### Tests and code coverage
**Unit tests** were performed using [criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/intro.html).  
In this project, **only** the **library code is covered**.
Unit tests are still to be performed, but a large part of the code is already covered.

You can compile the project and run the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make tests_run
```


## Compilation üõ†Ô∏è
You can compile the project with this command :
```sh
make
```

If you want clean the project, you can run this command :
```sh
make fclean
```

You can clean and compile the project with ```make re```.

You can compile the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make unit_tests
```


## Code mandatory üì¶
- You'll need to create a branch where you'll push your code. Once you've completed your tasks on this branch, we'll work together to merge it and check that everything works.
- Every function you add must be code-style.
- Before merging, you'll need to check that all unit tests pass by running ```make tests_run```.
- Each commit will contain ```[+]``` or ```[-]``` or ```[~]``` followed by a message
    - ```[+]``` : Add feature
    - ```[-]``` : Delete feature
    - ```[~]``` : Edit feature

**Of course, in exceptional cases, we may depart from these rules.**


## What's next ? üöÄ
- Add help section
- Add github actions
- Improve the memory management
- Add a documentation for each function
- Add unit tests on each piece of code
